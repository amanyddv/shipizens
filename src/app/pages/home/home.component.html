        <h2>How we work ?</h2>
        <p>The following steps are taken during the shipping procedure via our website: <br>  <br>
            1. Customers fill out personal and contact information, such as their name, address, email address, and phone number, to create an account on the website. <br> <br>
            2. Customers enter package information, including the size, weight, contents, and delivery address. <br> <br>
            3. Based on aspects including cost, delivery time, and package size, customers choose a shipping carrier and service level. <br> <br>
            4.  Then, the customer selects their payment mode and enters all the necessary details that follow. <br> <br>
            5. Once the package information and payment details are submitted, the website generates a shipping label with all the necessary information for the carrier to deliver the package. <br> <br>
            6. After that, the transporter arrives at the customer's location within the estimated time, and the customer delivers their packages to the transporter. <br> <br>
            7. The customer can utilize the tracking number provided by the website to follow the package's path from pickup through delivery. <br> <br>
            8. Once the package is delivered, the carrier confirms it, and the website updates the customer's account with the delivery status. <br></p>
